Hi the world!

My name is Evelyn. My work history shows a marked tendency toward taking jobs in service to the U.S.A., Which to me is the support and defense of the people of this country.

My current dream is to create tools and methods that help people to help themselves, as I have ever believed in the fable of teaching a man to fish.
